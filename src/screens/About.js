                            &emsp;The framework aims to automatically identify various regions within a 
                            hyperspectral image by classifying each pixel of 
                            the image and associating them to class segments. A multi-layer
                            system will be developed, where each layer’s responsibility is to perform an operation on its input, 
                            generate region classification data, and pass the resultant output to the next layer. 
                            Importantly, each layer analyzes its input from distinct viewpoints, utilizing spectral 
                            and spatial data, resulting in a multi-layer frameworkwhere the layers complement each
                            other. Since the system is highly parallelizable, we will exploit high performance 
                            computing (HPC) tools and resources to achieve a real-time performance.

                            &emsp;Although the proposed framework is a domain independent solution, it will be applied to the 
                            atmospheric cloud detection problem, where cloud albedos on the earth’s surface 
                            are measured by field experts. This problem has been chosen for two reasons: 1) 
                            cloud detection is a unique and challenging problem involving multi-class classification
                            and segmentation to evaluate the framework; and 2) to the best of our knowledge, HSI 
                            has not been applied to the cloud detection problem.  With the rich spectral 
                            information from a large portion of the spectrum, HSI has a big potential for accurate 
                            cloud region detection. The initial data analysis perfomed supported this argument by identifying 
                            informative features at beyond visible light.
